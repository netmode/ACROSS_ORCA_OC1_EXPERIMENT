PU_detect_channel.py:
PUs transmit frames using a certain access code. PU_detect_channel listens in the channel for frames with that specific access code and writes them to a file.

PU_availability.py:
Detects PU activity in every channel by calling PU_detect_channel. By checking the size of the corresponding file it can infer if the channel was with or without PU transmissions.
